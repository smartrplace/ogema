/**
 * The SerializationManager provides methods to serialize Java objects,
 * particularly OGEMA-specific ones, to text strings. This also defines a format
 * for the exchange of OGEMA objects (resources, widgets, resource access
 * declarations) with external communication partners.<br>
 *
 * The message-defining XSD provides two ways in which a resource's sub-resource
 * can be added to the text message: as a full representation or as a link. The
 * actual choice partly depends on the parameters set on this
 * SerializationManager. For example, sub-resources are added as links once the
 * maximum recursion depth is reached. If the same resource is encountered more
 * than once during serialization, subsequent encounters are always included as
 * links (to avoid messages blowing up in case of loops in the resource graph).
 *
 * Some parameters defining the serialization behavior can be configured via the
 * methods
 * {@link #setMaxDepth(int) } {@link #setFollowReferences(boolean)}
 * and {@link #setSerializeSchedules(boolean)}. The defaults are:<br>
 * * setMaxDepth(X), with X much larger than one (effectively recursive) <br>
 * * setFollowReferences(true) <br>
 * * setSerializeSchedules(false) <br>
